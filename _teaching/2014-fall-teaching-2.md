I taught this course to undergraduate students majoring in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Economics over five semesters (Fall 2017, Spring 2018, Fall 2018, Spring 2019, Fall 2019). These courses provided students with statistical knowledge (popular distributions, the central limit theorem, parameter estimates, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and linear regressions) and the application of real datasets customized according to the learners' majors. In the lab, students learned how to use R programming. Students presented their projects at the end of the course, applying the tools provided during the course lectures.
