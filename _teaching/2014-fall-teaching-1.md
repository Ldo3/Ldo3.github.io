I taught three calculus courses to undergraduate students majoring in Mathematics in three semesters (Fall 2017, Spring 2018, and Fall 2018). These courses provided students with core mathematical knowledge: limits, derivatives, integrals, and infinite series.

The topic covered during the courses 

# Calculus 1 (Differential Calculus)
Focus: Understanding and applying derivatives, introductory integration concepts.

* Functions, limits, and continuity
* Derivatives and differentiation rules (power, product, quotient, chain rules)
* Applications of derivatives:
     * Optimization problems
     * Related rates
     * Curve sketching (asymptotes, critical points, inflection points)
* Basic introduction to definite and indefinite integrals
* Fundamental Theorem of Calculus


# Calculus 2 (Integral Calculus and Series)
Focus: Mastery of integration and introduction to infinite series and alternate coordinate systems.

* Advanced integration techniques:
     * Substitution, integration by parts, partial fractions, trigonometric integrals
* Applications of integrals:
     * Volume (solid of revolution), arc length, work, and surface area
* Infinite sequences and series:
     * Convergence tests (e.g., ratio, root, comparison tests)
     * Taylor and Maclaurin series
* Polar coordinates and parametric equations


# Calculus 3 (Multivariable Calculus)
Focus: Extending calculus to higher dimensions and exploring vector fields.

* Functions of several variables, partial derivatives, and gradient
* Double and triple integrals and their applications (e.g., volume, mass)
* Vector calculus:
     * Line and surface integrals
     * Divergence and curl
     * Green's, Stokes', and Divergence theorems
* Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems
