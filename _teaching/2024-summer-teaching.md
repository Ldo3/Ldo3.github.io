I served as an Instructor for MATH1110 during the summer course 2024. My responsibilities included developing course materials and provided instruction both in and out of Instructureâ€™s Canvas LMS, integrated external tools like WebAssign and MyLab into Canvas LMS, delivering lectures, clarifying statistical concepts, guiding practical implementation, leading problem-solving sessions, grading assignments, and providing individualized support to students to enhance their understanding of course material. 


The course covers: Elementary probability theory and statistics with applications; random variables; distributions including a thorough discussion of the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions; central limit theorem; histograms; sampling distributions; confidence intervals; tests of hypotheses; linear models; regression.
