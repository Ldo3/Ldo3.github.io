I served as a Teaching Assistant for MATH1110 for over two semesters, during which I taught two classes per semester (Fall 2021, Spring 2022). In this course, my instructions involve clarifying probability and statistical concepts, guiding practical implementation. The course covers: Elementary probability theory and statistics with applications; random variables; distributions including a thorough discussion of the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions; central limit theorem; histograms; sampling distributions; confidence intervals; tests of hypotheses; linear models; regression.
