Welcome! I’m Thuy Linh Do (you can call me Linh), a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics at Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana. I am advised by Professor [Scott A. McKinley](https://www.stochastics-lab.net/). My research focuses on particle tracking, changepoint detection algorithms, Bayesian statistics, model selection, and mixtures of models, with the goal of advancing innovative methods in applied mathematics and statistics.


As an educator, I firmly believe that every student can achieve fluency in the language of mathematics and uncover the profound beauty and power it embodies. I strive to foster an inclusive and engaging learning environment where curiosity and exploration are celebrated.


Outside of academia, I’m passionate about music and singing. I often find intriguing connections between the harmonies of music and the structures of mathematics and statistics, which inspire both my creative and analytical pursuits.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out—I’d love to connect!
